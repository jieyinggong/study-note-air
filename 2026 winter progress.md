# 选修
如果要读研这两个要更认真一点（）
拿推荐信！
虽然paco和thierry现在已经能要得到推荐信吧
这么说我还是有准备一点的
好像推荐信确实不太需要担心
huang也肯定会给我推荐信
其实还有cho但是他外聘
我实习也能有雇主推荐信（除非我干的很烂，但是不太可能）

Tutorial

Attendance and

participation

**20%** throughout

the semester

Tutorials begin on **Jan 15**. There are **10** sessions and

each session **is worth 2%** of your total marks. Your

participation mark will be based on your attendance and

informed participation in tutorials. Informed participation

means that you read all assigned readings, complete the

assignment for the week **before** each tutorial session, and

actively distribute to tutorial discussion.

In-Lecture

Activities and

Pop Quizzes

**10%** various dates

throughout

the semester

There will be 3-5 short in-class activities or pop quizzes.

All in-class assignments are open book and may be

completely individual or with classmates. The purpose of

this assignment is to facilitate class participation, not

memorization. In-class activities or quizzes must be

submitted **by 11:59pm** on the same day on Quercus.

The Lost Art of

Copying

**15% Three Times**

**during the**

**semester**

You will choose **three reading** from a provided list (on

Quercus under “file”) and produce a handwritten copy of

each reading, including margin notes based on

instructions provided in class. You may upload a

scanned copy, or a clear photography, or submit the

physical pages to your tutorial instructor.

The purpose of this assignment is to practice slow and

close reading, attention to language and analytical

notetaking. It also trains your brain to feel more at ease

with writing and help you build comfort and confidence

with academic expression. More detailed instructions will

be given in class.

The Messy Mid-

Term

**25% Written**

**Mid-term**

**Feb 25**

By 11:59pm,

Bring a copy

to tutorial on

Feb 26,

Peer and

Self-

Evaluation

uploaded by

Feb 26,

11:59

The mid-term asks you to choose an area of personal

expertise or interest (any area works as long as it’s

something you know well or passionate about, e.g.,

beauty and makeup, gaming, fan culture, popular

psychology, AI, vampires, sport, finance…) and do a

power diagnose using feminist theories. For example, you

can analyze how power operates in the area you choose

and identify forms of inequality, oppression, exclusion or

ideological assumptions.

After the power diagnose, you will make a fix-it plan

which propose a concrete intervention or redesign that

addresses the issues you identified. The plan should be

imaginative but realistic (e.g., redesigning a game5

feature, rewriting a popular fiction, or TV show, creating

a new work practice, etc.).

More instructions and examples will be discussed in the

lectures. Worksheets and step-by-step guidance will be

provided in tutorials.

You must upload your mid-term on Quercus by 11:59pm

Feb 25 and bring a copy to their tutorial on Feb 26, so

that your peer will have time to read it. In tutorial, you

will work with one classmate to revalue each other’s

work and do a self-evaluation. The peer and self-

evaluation must be uploaded on Quercus by 11:59pm,

Feb 26.

The tutorial instructor will grade your mid-term using the

evaluations as part of the assessment.

Final Project-

Mock Teaching

Portfolio

**30% April 9**

11:59pm

on Quercus

Teaching is the best learning. For the final project, you

will create a teaching portfolio as if you are as feminist

instructor preparing to teach a 45-60 mins lesson on any

topic you choose.

You may design your lesson for various audience using

your preferred form: e.g., high school students, university

students, podcast listener, social media channel,

community workshops, gamers, AI developers, vampire

elders, etc. You can be creative!

Your portfolio should include a teaching plan that

outlines your audience, the context of learning, learning

objectives, key concepts, required materials and class

flow (timing and structure). You should write a teaching

script that reads like what you would say in a real class or

the context of your choice. The script should demonstrate

your understanding of the feminist theories and your

analytical skills. It should also include some actives

appropriate for the topic and your intended audience.

Lectures and tutorials throughout March will guide you

through building your portfolio step-by-step. You are

encouraged to ask questions and use your tutorial

instructor as a resource. The tutorial instructor will grade

your final using your self-evaluations as part of the

assessment.
